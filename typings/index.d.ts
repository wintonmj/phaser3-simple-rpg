/**
 * @fileoverview Global type definitions for the Phaser3 Simple RPG game
 * 
 * This directory contains global TypeScript type definitions that are
 * referenced in tsconfig.json and available throughout the project without
 * explicit imports.
 * 
 * File structure:
 * - typings.d.ts: Module declarations for non-TypeScript files (e.g., JSON)
 * - phaser.d.ts: Complete Phaser type definitions
 * 
 * Note: Project-specific type definitions are stored in /src/types and
 * should be imported explicitly where needed.
