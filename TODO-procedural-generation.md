# TODO List for Implementing Room-Based Procedural Generation (Option 1)

## 1. Core Architecture Setup
- [ ] Create a new `ProceduralLevel` class that extends `AbstractScene`
- [ ] Add the new scene to the `SCENES` constant in `scenes.ts`
- [ ] Add map configuration to the `MAPS` constant in `maps.ts`
- [ ] Create a new `ProceduralMapGenerator` utility class to handle map generation

## 2. Room Generation System
- [ ] Define a `Room` class with properties:
  - [ ] Position (x, y coordinates)
  - [ ] Size (width, height)
  - [ ] Type (start, end, treasure, enemy, etc.)
  - [ ] Connections (doors to other rooms)
  - [ ] Content (enemies, items, etc.)
- [ ] Implement a `RoomGenerator` class with methods:
  - [ ] `generateRoom(type, size)`: Creates a room of specified type and size
  - [ ] `populateRoom(room)`: Adds appropriate content to a room based on its type
  - [ ] `createDoors(room)`: Adds doors to connect with other rooms

## 3. Level Layout Generation
- [ ] Implement a `LevelLayoutGenerator` class with methods:
  - [ ] `generateGrid(width, height)`: Creates a grid of possible room positions
  - [ ] `placeRooms(grid)`: Places rooms on the grid
  - [ ] `connectRooms(rooms)`: Creates corridors between connected rooms
  - [ ] `validateLayout(layout)`: Ensures the layout is playable (all rooms accessible)
- [ ] Create algorithms for:
  - [ ] Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for room placement
  - [ ] Minimum Spanning Tree for ensuring connectivity
  - [ ] A* pathfinding for corridor creation

## 4. Map Data Conversion
- [ ] Create a `MapDataConverter` class to convert the procedural layout to Phaser-compatible format
- [ ] Implement methods to:
  - [ ] Convert room layouts to tile data
  - [ ] Generate collision data
  - [ ] Create object layers for enemies, items, etc.
- [ ] Add support for:
  - [ ] Different tile types (floor, wall, door, etc.)
  - [ ] Decorative elements
  - [ ] Special tiles (traps, switches, etc.)

## 5. Game Object Placement
- [ ] Extend the `AbstractScene` class to handle procedurally placed game objects
- [ ] Create a `GameObjectPlacer` class with methods:
  - [ ] `placeEnemies(room)`: Adds appropriate enemies based on room type
  - [ ] `placeItems(room)`: Adds treasure and items
  - [ ] `placeNPCs(room)`: Adds NPCs for quests or dialogue
  - [ ] `placeEnvironment(room)`: Adds environmental elements (water, lava, etc.)
- [ ] Implement difficulty scaling based on:
  - [ ] Room type
  - [ ] Distance from start
  - [ ] Player level/equipment

## 6. Level Progression and Balance
- [ ] Create a `LevelDifficultyManager` class to:
  - [ ] Scale enemy difficulty based on level progression
  - [ ] Balance treasure and reward distribution
  - [ ] Ensure appropriate challenge curve
- [ ] Implement a seed system for:
  - [ ] Reproducible level generation
  - [ ] Sharing interesting levels
  - [ ] Debugging and testing

## 7. Integration with Existing Systems
- [ ] Modify the `GameManager` to handle transitions to/from procedural levels
- [ ] Update the HUD to display level information
- [ ] Ensure save/load functionality works with procedural levels
- [ ] Add level completion conditions specific to procedural generation

## 8. Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Create a test mode for rapid iteration on generation algorithms
- [ ] Implement metrics for evaluating level quality:
  - [ ] Connectivity
  - [ ] Enemy distribution
  - [ ] Treasure balance
  - [ ] Path length and complexity
- [ ] Add debugging tools to visualize the generation process
- [ ] Create a feedback system to identify and fix generation issues

## 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize the generation algorithms
- [ ] Implement level streaming for very large levels
- [ ] Add caching for frequently used room templates
- [ ] Optimize collision detection for procedural layouts

## 10. Polish and Features
- [ ] Add visual variety to rooms (different floor patterns, wall types)
- [ ] Implement special rooms with unique mechanics
- [ ] Add secret passages and hidden areas
- [ ] Create themed level sets (dungeon, forest, castle, etc.)
- [ ] Add environmental storytelling elements
